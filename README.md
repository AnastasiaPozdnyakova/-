This game runs on python

Hello and welcome to my project : The Hangman game! The game is made and works in python and is playable. When you start the game, you are given a set of rules and instructions on how to play the game, however standard hangman rules applying: a random word is generated and you have to guess it by letters, if your guess is wrong, you will get a message about it from the game, if it is correct, the game will show you where the letter that you guessed is in your target word. Every guess you make a “life” Is deducted, the aim of the game is to guess the word in a limited amount of guesses.
I hope you do like my project, have fun!
Usable commands: "дайответблин" и "gimmetheanswer"

How the game goes: at the start random amount of # is printed, each one actually, being a letter in a random word from my list of words, when you guess a letter, and it is correct, the # which is the letter you guessed will change to the letter.
